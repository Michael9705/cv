    <p>
      Inspired by physics, I decided to major in Mechanical Engineering for
      undergraduate study. With the purpose of pursuing further developments in
      Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, I'm currently studying at Columbia
      University for a MS degree with a concentration in Robotics and Controls.

    <p>
      As I step deeper into the field, I realized that the core part in
      manipulating robots are the algorithms. So I decide to shift my focus into
      computer science and try to build my own projects or softwares that helps
      not only robots to work, but also heling people to live a more convenient
      life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Except of being a detail-oriented person with solid engineering knowledge
      and skills, I also keep an eye on larger scope about how things developed,
      which enables me to have a general plan and management of projects I have
      participated.
